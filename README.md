# Antipode_Calculator
This app will show you the exact opposite point on Earth of a given location.  

Have you ever been so curious as to wonder where the opposite side of the Earth is from where you are? Maybe you figure its somewhere where there is land, specifically somewhere in East Asia? 
Well question no longer, type in an adress, the name of a state or country and see where it is. If you are in North America, Im sorry to spoil it but its in the Southern Indian Ocean.





This app does not store any imputs, addresses or calculated numbers.

This app was just a fun little project when I was bored one day, not looking for serious updates or additions but if you insist, just go for it.
